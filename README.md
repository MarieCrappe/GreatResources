### Machine Learning - General

- **A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning** : http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/
One of the best webpages I know to introduce Machine Learning to newbies, a small jewel made with D3JS.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms Cheat Sheet** :
https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2017/04/12/machine-learning-algorithm-use/

### Neural Networks
- Great tool to better understand what is a neural network :
http://playground.tensorflow.org/

- Blog with really cool & precise articles about Deep Learning :
https://adeshpande3.github.io/

- Good article about **Transfer Learning in Tensorflow** (Feb. 2017) :
https://kwotsin.github.io/tech/2017/02/11/transfer-learning.html

## Programming Languages
*Good references to learn, practice and stay up-to-date with different programming languages.*

Learning to program is often exhilarating and challenging. It can be rewarding and fun... but also, sometimes, exhausting, frustrating, and overwhelming! Here are some websites, courses, documents and articles to make your journey through code smoother and your life easier ;-)

- Great website for **code newbies** as well as **experienced programmers**: http://exercism.io/
Exercism provides exercises in the format of mini-quests in over 30 different languages! Among them : Java, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, C, C++ & much more.

### Python
[Coming soon]

### PHP
- PHP-FIG (PHP Standards Recommendations) :
https://www.php-fig.org/psr/

## Programming & Software Craftmanship
*Master the art of clean code!*

[Definition & more to come]

*"There's an art and a science to transforming unmaintainable code into elegant simplicity. It takes practice, experimentation, and deep thought."* (quote from Exercism.io)

- The GitHub guide to master Markdown, simple and super useful :
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

### Command Line
- **Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous** by Michael Hartl : https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial
A tutorial introduction to the Unix command line

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a practice that has become mainstream over the past decade or so.

There are many good reasons to do TDD. Here are a few:

* It helps you focus on smaller pieces at a time.
* It protects you against accidentally breaking things later.
* It makes it a little more likely that you'll write simpler code... because complicated code is ridiculously hard to test.
There are great conference talks and blog posts about TDD (how to do it, why to do it, how people do it wrong, etc, etc, etc).

### Reading list
Those a GREAT books :
- Software Craftmanship
- Clean Code
