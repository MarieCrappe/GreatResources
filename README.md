### Generative Adversarial Networks 
Generative Adversearial Networks (GANs) are quite interesting as they are unsupervised machine learning algorithms, actually using neural networks. Here are two companies using them for their products : 
- http://hackrod.com/
- https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/generative-design
- More interesting stuff about GANs will come ;-)

## Programming Languages
*Good references to learn, practice and stay up-to-date with different programming languages.*

Learning to program is often exhilarating and challenging. It can be rewarding and fun... but also, sometimes, exhausting, frustrating, and overwhelming! Here are some websites, courses, documents and articles to make your journey through code smoother and your life easier ;-)

- Great website for **code newbies** as well as **experienced programmers**: http://exercism.io/
Exercism provides exercises in the format of mini-quests in over 30 different languages! Among them : Java, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, C, C++ & much more.

### Python
[Coming soon]

### PHP
- PHP-FIG = **PHP Standards Recommendations** :
https://www.php-fig.org/psr/

## Programming & Software Craftmanship
*Master the art of clean code!*

[Definition & more to come]

*"There's an art and a science to transforming unmaintainable code into elegant simplicity. It takes practice, experimentation, and deep thought."* (quote from Exercism.io)

- **The GitHub guide to master Markdown**, simple and super useful :
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

### Command Line
- **Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous** by Michael Hartl : https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial
A tutorial introduction to the Unix command line

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a practice that has become mainstream over the past decade or so.

There are many good reasons to do TDD. Here are a few:

* It helps you focus on smaller pieces at a time.
* It protects you against accidentally breaking things later.
* It makes it a little more likely that you'll write simpler code... because complicated code is ridiculously hard to test.
There are great conference talks and blog posts about TDD (how to do it, why to do it, how people do it wrong, etc, etc, etc).

### Reading list
Those a GREAT books :
- *Software Craftmanship*
- *Clean Code*

## Small Everyday Hacks
- **How to send emails with Gmail using Python** : http://stackabuse.com/how-to-send-emails-with-gmail-using-python/
- **Twitter Follow Bot** : https://github.com/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot A Python bot that automates several actions on Twitter, such as following users and favoriting tweets.
- Want to get your hands a bit dirty ? Try to implement this cool **data pipeline for Twitter using the Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) : https://github.com/TheRinger/ELK_twitter
You'll get beautiful, quick and easy-to-use dashboards with those tools !
